# RubyConf Australia 2013 Call for Proposals

So, you are interested in giving a talk at [RubyConf Australia 2013](http://rubyconf.org.au), 
the first ever Ruby conference to be held in Australia? 

What better way to submit a talk proposal than via GitHub! 

## Here is what to do

1. Fork this repository
2. Copy the sample folder `example/` to `your_name-talk_name`
3. Edit the `README.md` file and type a good description about your talk
   and about yourself
4. Replace the `profile_picture.jpg` with a picture of yourself that we
   can use to list you on the speakers page when you are accepted.
5. Create a pull request of your fork

You can add any type of assets to support your proposal inside your folder.
When a talk gets accepted we will press the lovely green merge button.
